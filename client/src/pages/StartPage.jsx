/*
Start Page:

Objectives that need implementation:
This page was made as the initial point for the user to navigate
the idea was that the user sees the Big Logo 
presses on it and the journey within the app starts

This is on on the LOGO component:
const handleLogoClick = () => {
    navigate("/audio-upload"); // Navigate to the AudioUpload page when the logo is clicked
  };

The conditional rendering on the app component has not been implemented for this to happen.
